Baseline : agressive setup
Track temp 30Â°C  62L OF FUEL HAVEN'T TRIED LESS. BEHAVES FINE WHEN FUEL GOES DOWN I THINK
Best lap :  1.49.5
Avg : Arround 1.50.0

Hot PSI & temps :
	28 to 28.4(out of lesmos) 		27.8
	89	92	95			79	77	74
		
	27.7					27.6
	89	92	95			87	84	81

What I changed : 

+1 click front suspension
-1 click rear suspension
Caster from 9.4 to 8.4 
Brake bias from 60 to 59%
Ride height +1 click on both front and rear
Closed brake ducts to 2 on the front, 1 on the rear

Noticable stuff :

I think i made it more stable, might be a bit harsh when attacking the kerbs. Not sure, might be overdriving (dunno what to change to see if it's that)
It doesn't really like throttle application in mid speed corners like Ascari right hander and Parabolica -> Rear a bit loose? Feels like there's time to be found there? 
	-> Was worse before changes. With a bit more testing, if you try to push in parabolica, it feels like the rear gets a tad loose. (Fuel?)
